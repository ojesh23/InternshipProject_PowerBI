# InternshipProject_PowerBI

As a part of the project deliverables, our client The Youth Junction Inc. (TYJ), a non-profit organization needed a reliable means to deliver a program based reports to the government for funding requirements. Previously the client identified gaps in their manual reporting system that made the users readability ineffective. Keeping the privacy concerns in mind, the client provided our team a de-identified dataset, that consisted of 200+ columns and inconsistent data fields. Leveraging our data analytics skills, using Excel and Power BI, we were able to clean and prepare the data that were transformed to the different visualization and showcasing the information of different program based insights as well as the demographic information. 

In this repository, there consists two files, that were contributed as my personal repsonisibility. They are: 
PowerBI_Generic_And_Classified.pbix a Power BI file that contains 9 visual reports and PowerBI_Generic_And_Classified.pdf, which is the exported report generated in Power BI.
